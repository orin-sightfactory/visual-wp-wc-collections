= USE OF 3RD PARTY SERVICES =
VWP Woocommerce Collections relies on Google Fonts for rendering some parts of the administrative interface. The Google Fonts API is designed to limit the collection, storage, and use of end-user data to only what is needed to serve fonts efficiently. 

The use of the Google Fonts Web API is unauthenticated and the Google Fonts API does not set or log cookies. 
IP addresses are not logged or stored on Google's servers and are not analyzed for any purpose. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent, and referrer). 

Access to this data is limited and tightly controlled. View the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy below for additional information.
